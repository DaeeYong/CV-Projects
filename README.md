# Computer Vision projects

This project focuses on fundamental traditional computer vision techniques including:
- **Coin Counting**: Detects and counts coins in an image using Hough Transform.
- **Image Stitching**: Merges two images by computing homography.
- **Multiband Image Blending**: Combines two images using Laplacian pyramid blending.

Each technique is implemented separately, and detailed explanations are provided in their respective sections.
